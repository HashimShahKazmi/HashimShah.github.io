           Hold your horses. Obviously Sindh is worth a bit of challenge, else I wouldn’t bother recommending it to you!
           <br>
     
Sindh isn’t as dangerous as some may lead you to believe, and it’s an adventure traveler’s dream.
            <br>

Sindh is practically overflowing with myriad cultures and historical places. Jains, Hindus, Sikhs, and Muslims all reside within the province. Crumbling remains of forgotten forts and mosques wait by roadsides, while towering forts and majestic mahals still loom over the land.<br>

        Best time of year to visit Sindh.

    </h2> 
        
        Now that I’ve convinced you to give Sindh a try, let’s talk about how to avoid death by heat in during your trip.
        
        <br>
        <br>
        Sindh is hot like fire. Two of my visits to Sindh were in May, the peak of summertime in Pakistan and absolutely the <strong> worst </strong> time to visit the province.
        
        <br>
        <br>
        <em>
        I experienced temperatures nearing 50°C, and must say that I do not recommend summer travel in Sindh.
        </em>
        
        <br>
        <br>
        If you want to actually <em> enjoy </em> your explorations of Sindh/not die from heat stroke, plan a winter trip.
        
        <br>
        <br>
        Winter starts a bit after the end of the monsoon season that loosely runs from July to September. Temperatures begin to “cool” around October (if temperatures in the 20-30°C range count as cool to you) and winter goes on until February or so.

        <h2>
            Sindhi Culture.
        </h2>
            The province of Sindh has been named after the famous River Indus. In Sanskrit, the province was dubbed Sindhu meaning the River Indus. Around more than 5000 years ago, Dravidian cultures urbanized and gave rise to the Indus Valley Civilization. According to the Historians, Indus Valley Civilization declined due to the natural disasters such as floods but the invasions of Indo- Aryans around 5000 years back caused the sudden collapse of it. In the recent history, Sindh was conquered by the British in 1843. Sindh province remained the part of British India until 1947 when it was made one of the provinces of Pakistan.

        <h3>
            Language.
        </h3>
        
        Sindhi language is an ancient language spoken in Pakistan and many other parts of the world. It is an Indo-Aryan language spoken by approximately 41 million people in Pakistan, and 12 million people in India; it is the second most spoken language of Pakistan, mostly spoken in the Sindh province. It is a recognized official language in Pakistan, and also an official language in India. Government of Pakistan issues National Identity Cards to its citizens only in two languages; Sindhi and Urdu.
        <br>
        <br>
        
        Sindhi language is also greatly influenced by Sanskrit and about 70% of the words in Sindhi are of Sanskrit origin. Sindhi is a very rich language with a vast vocabulary; this has made it a favorite of many writers and so a lot of literature and poetry has been written in Sindhi. It has been the inspiration for Sindhi art, music, literature, culture and the way of life. The language can be written using the Devanagri or Arabic script
        
        <h2>
            Cultural character.
        </h2>
        
        The ancient Sindhi civilization was the place, where the aesthetic utilization of leisure was freely indulged. There has been evidence, that the excavations of sites dating back to 3000  B.C (all over Sindh) is also true, around 1200 years ago when Jaina Dakshiniya Chihna (778 A.D.) described the distinguished features of Sindhi’s in this way: “Elegant, with a lovely, soft and slow gait, they are fond of the art of harvas (that is, songs, music and dancing) and full affection towards their country.” Sindhi’s celebrate Sindh Cultural day worldwide on 6th December by wearing Ajrak & Sindhi Topi on that time.

            Keenjhar Lake 
        </h2>
        
        This mythical lake is about an hour’s drive from Thatta. It’s a popular picnic spot and weekend getaway for people in the region, as well as a resting place for migratory birds in winter months. Legend has it a wealthy prince fell in love with a woman from Keenjhar, and made her a queen above all other queens. As a testament to their love, the prince’s tomb is on a small island in the middle of the lake.

        <h2>
            About Sindhi Food.
        </h2>
        
        Although Sindh is a relatively a small piece of land country, the cuisine has developed over many more years and incorporates elements from its neighbours – India, Afghanistan and Iran. The varied regions also means there are a wide range of different foods – from the fertile valleys and the sea of Sindh ; to pastoral Baluchistan from neighbouring Iran; to the neighbouring Punjab with its five rivers and the rugged North West Frontier, home of the chapli kebab.

The blend of Indian, Far Eastern and Middle Eastern cooking techniques creates a distinctive mix of complex flavours. The use of pomegranate seeds in some meat dishes adds a sweet, sour note and reflects the Middle Eastern influence on the food.

        Although whatever you choose as there is so much variety available, but I will recommend you something which personally I like so much and that is the
<strong><em> Beef Burger </em></strong> with some Sindhi flavor added to it.
